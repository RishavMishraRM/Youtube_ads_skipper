This is a program written in python programming language. It automatically clicks on the 'skip ad' button on the youtube ads. It uses opencv library's Template Matching functionality to do that.<br>
It loads templates of skip ad button for various resolution and zoom sizes of the screen to make it platform independent.<br>
It is successfully working on different machines with different resolutions.
